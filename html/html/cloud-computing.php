                <h3 class="sub-heading">Cloud App Development</h3>
                <p>We develop and deploy cloud applications, each designed to be browser-agnostic, future-proof and highly scalable. We combine mobile-first design techniques with inscrutable server-side programming and rich database functionality to create high-performance enterprise cloud apps. Our integration services allow for cloud applications to deploy in public, private or hybrid environments. </p>
                <h3 class="sub-heading">Cloud Migration Services</h3>
                <p>We are managed service providers to migrate apps, workflows and whole enterprise infrastructures to the cloud using thoughtful migration methods that limit system downtime and ensure data integrity. We also supply platform and cloud infrastructure refactoring services, if necessary. Whenever possible, we opt for parallel and automated migration methods. </p>
                <h3 class="sub-heading">Cloud Computing Architecture</h3>
                <p>Cloud architecture is critical for eliminating siloed data and ensuring mission-critical processes “communicate” with one another. We leverage enterprise service buses and service-oriented architectures to streamline data flows and publish your APIs in the cloud to facilitate easy third-party integrations. </p>
                <h3 class="sub-heading">Cloud Backup Solutions</h3>
                <p>To guard against disastrous system outages or data losses, we can construct community-based, distributed, inter-cloud and multi-cloud solutions. We have experience building cloud storage solutions that live on most popular IaaS offerings – Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform, to name a few – as well as combinations of multiple hosts. </p>
